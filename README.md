# Google Translate Better Tabs

## My Issue

I usually have multiple tabs of [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/) open at once, because I like to compare the same word in multiple different languages. But the tabs don't give me any useful information on a glance, so I end up clicking on a bunch of different tabs looking for the language pairing I want.

## The Solution

This chrome extension rewrite the title for each tab in the browser, to match the language pairing that is currently being translated.
