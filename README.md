# Google Translate Better Tabs

## My Issue

I usually have multiple tabs of [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/) open at the same time, and sometimes I forget which tab is translating which languages. All the tabs say Google Translate which is not helpful. 

## The Solution

This chrome extension will rewrite the title for each tab to match the language pairing that is currently being translated.
