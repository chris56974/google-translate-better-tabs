# Google Translate Better Tabs

## My Issue

I usually have multiple tabs of [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/) open at once, and sometimes I forget which tab is translating what. I usually end up clicking randomly until I find the right tab again. 

## The Solution

This chrome extension will rewrite the title for each tab to match the language pairing that is currently being translated.
